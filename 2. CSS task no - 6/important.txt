In CSS, specificity determines which style rules are applied to an element when multiple rules could apply. Here's a breakdown of the order of specificity:

Inline Style: Styles applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute. These styles have the highest specificity and will override other styles.

ID Selector (#): Styles applied using an ID selector. IDs are unique to each element and have higher specificity than classes or element selectors.

Class or Attribute Selector (.class, [attr]): Styles applied using class or attribute selectors. These selectors target multiple elements and have lower specificity than IDs but higher than element selectors.

Element Selector (tag name): Styles applied using an element selector (e.g., div, p, h1). These styles target all elements of a specific type and have lower specificity than classes or IDs.

Universal Selector (*): Styles applied using a universal selector. This selector targets all elements in the document and has the lowest specificity.

In summary, the order of specificity determines which style rules take precedence when multiple rules apply to the same element. Styles applied with higher specificity override styles applied with lower specificity.

In CSS, specificity is a way to determine which styles are applied to an element when there are conflicting styles. 
It's calculated based on the different parts of a selector.

Here's a simplified explanation:

Universal selector (*): 0

Element selectors (div, p, etc.) and pseudo-elements (::before, ::after): 1

Class selectors (.class), attribute selectors ([attribute]), and pseudo-classes (:hover, :nth-child()): 10

ID selectors (#id): 100

Inline styles (styles applied directly to an element's style attribute): 1000

To calculate specificity:


Start with 0.

Add 1 for each element selector and pseudo-element.

Add 10 for each class selector, attribute selector, and pseudo-class.

Add 100 for each ID selector.

Add 1000 for inline styles.

For example, the selector div#content.article p would have a specificity of 111 (1 for div, 100 for #content, 10 for .article, and 1 for p).
