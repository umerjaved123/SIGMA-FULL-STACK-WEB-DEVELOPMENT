    <h1>CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders</h1>


    In CSS, padding is the space between the content of an element and its border, while margin is the space outside the border of an element. So, if you're asking whether it's correct to apply padding inside a container and margin outside the container, then yes, that's generally correct.



    <div class="container">

        <div class="inside"></div>

    </div>



    <div class="box box1">I am a box</div>

    <div class="box box2">I am a another box</div>

    <div class="box box3">I am a another box</div>



    <!-- box-sizing: border-box; is a CSS property that affects the way the size of an element is calculated.

Normally, when you set the width or height of an element, the browser calculates the total size of the element including its content, padding, and border. This is called the "content-box" model.

When you use box-sizing: border-box;, the width and height properties include the padding and border of the element, but not the margin. This can make it easier to size elements consistently, especially in responsive designs, because you don't have to adjust for the padding and border separately. -->
