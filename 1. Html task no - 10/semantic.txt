Types of HTML Semantic Tags
Semantic tags can define different parts of a webpage. 

Let's take a look at the most common semantic HTML elements, divided into two categories based on their usage:

HTML semantic tags for structure
HTML semantic tags for text
HTML Semantic Tags for Structure
Many semantic HTML tags communicate the layout of a page. 

These “structural” tags were introduced when HTML4 got upgraded to HTML5. That's why they're also commonly known as semantic HTML5 tags or semantic HTML5 elements.

 A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <form> , <table> , and <article> - Clearly defines its content. -->

        

        Some of the most commonly used semantic HTML tags include

<header> –  define the header of a document or a section
<nav> –  define a section of navigation links
<main> –  define the main content of a document
<section> –  group related content together
<article> –  define an independent, self-contained piece of content
<aside> –  define content that is tangentially related to the surrounding content
<footer> –  define the footer of document
<figure> –  group multimedia content with a caption
<figcaption> –  provide a caption or description for multimedia content
<time> –  define a date or time.



Here’s a full list: 

<header>: The header tag defines content that should be considered the introductory information of a page or section
<nav>: The navigation tag is used for navigation links. It can be nested within the <header> tag, but secondary navigation <nav> tags are also commonly used elsewhere on the page.
<main>: This tag contains the main content (also called the body) of a page. There should be only one tag per page.
<article>: The article tag defines content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on. It does not necessarily mean a “blog post.” Think of it more as “an article of clothing”—a self-contained item that can be used in various contexts.
<section>: Using <section> is a way of grouping nearby content of a similar theme. A section tag differs from an article tag. It isn’t necessarily self-contained, but it forms part of something else. 
<aside>: An aside element defines content that’s less important. It’s often used for sidebars—areas that add complementary but nonessential information.
<footer>: You use <footer> at the bottom of a page. It usually includes contact information, copyright information, and some site navigation.




HTML Semantic Tags for Text
The semantic HTML tags for text are HTML tags that—besides the formatting—also convey the semantic function of the text they contain.

Here are some of the most common examples:

<h1> (heading): The H1 tag marks the top level heading. There’s usually only one H1 heading per page.
<h2> to <h6> (subheadings): The subheadings of various levels of importance. There can be multiple headings of the same level on a single page. 
<p> (paragraph): A standalone paragraph of text.
<a> (anchor): Used to mark up a hyperlink from one page to another.
<ol> (ordered list): A list of items that are displayed in a particular order, starting with bullet points. One <li> (list item) tag contains a single item in the list.
<ul> (unordered list): A list of items that do not need to be displayed in a particular order, starting with ordinal numbers. One <li> (list item) tag contains a single item of the list. 
<q> / <blockquote>: A quotation of the text. Use <blockquote> for long, multi-line quotations and <q> for shorter, inline quotations.
<em> (emphasis): Used for text that should be emphasized.
<strong> (strong emphasis): Used for text that should be strongly emphasized.
<code>: A block of computer code.
