    <!-- HTML Quotation Tag
The use of quotations is common in textual content. HTML provides specific tags to handle this: <blockquote> for block quotations and <q> for inline quotations. In this blog, we'll explore these tags, their attributes, and how to style them.

What Are <blockquote> and <q> Tags?
The <blockquote> and <q> tags serve to define quotations in HTML. While <blockquote> is used for longer, block-level quotes, <q> is used for shorter, inline quotes.

Why Use These Tags?
They provide semantic meaning to your quotations, making it easier for search engines to understand the context and relevance of the content. -->

    <blockquote cite="source-url">Quotation text here.</blockquote>

    <!-- <q> Tag -->
    <q cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkCaOdOL0ys"
      >Quotation text here.</q
    >

    <!-- Obsolete HTML Tags
As HTML has evolved, some tags have been deprecated or become obsolete. While modern browsers might still support them, their use is discouraged in favor of CSS or more semantic HTML5 elements. In this blog, we'll explore some of these obsolete tags and their modern alternatives.

What Are Obsolete Tags?
Obsolete tags are HTML elements that are no longer recommended for use. They may lack support in modern browsers and are likely to be phased out entirely in future versions of HTML.

Why Avoid Obsolete Tags?
Compatibility Issues: Not supported by all modern browsers.
Accessibility: This may not meet current web accessibility standards.
Maintenance: Makes future updates difficult. -->

    <!-- 
Examples of Obsolete Tags
The <font> Tag
Used to specify text color, size, and font. -->

    <font color="red" size="3" face="verdana">This is some text</font>

    <!-- The <center> Tag
Used to center-align elements. -->

    <center>This text will be centered</center>

    <!-- The <u> Tag
Used to underline text. -->

    <u>This text will be underlined</u>

    <!-- Modern Alternatives
It's better to use CSS for styling and layout as it separates content from presentation. -->

    <!-- Replacing <font> -->

    <span style="color: red; font-size: 16px; font-family: verdana"
      >This is some text</span
    >
    <!-- Replacing <center> -->

    <div style="text-align: center">This text will be centered</div>
    <!-- Replacing <u> -->

    <span style="text-decoration: underline">This text will be underlined</span>
    <!-- Conclusion

Understanding obsolete HTML tags is not just a trip down memory lane; it also emphasizes the importance of keeping up to date with the latest web standards. Always opt for modern, semantic HTML and CSS for styling to ensure your websites are future-proof. -->
