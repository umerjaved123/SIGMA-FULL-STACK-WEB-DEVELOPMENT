<div>
    If you are using the HTML code to type in the entities, make sure they are preceded by an ampersand ( & ) and hash ( # ), and followed by a semicolon ( ; ). For example, &#62; for the greater than symbol so you get > to create that symbol.

<div> 
    An HTML entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand ( & ) and ends with a semicolon ( ; ). HTML entities are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces)

</div>


<div>  How to Use HTML Entities
    Entities can be implemented easily within HTML code. Here are some examples:
    
    Using Reserved Characters
    <p>The price is 10 &lt; 20.</p>
    Displaying Special Symbols
    <p>Copyright &copy; 2023.</p>
    Creating Non-Breaking Spaces
    <p>This is an example&nbsp;text.</p>
    Conclusion
    HTML entities are essential for rendering special or reserved characters on a web page. Understanding how to use them effectively is key to creating web pages that display content as intended.</div>


<!-- 

    why we use the pre tag :

    The <pre> tag defines preformatted text. Text in a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code. -->



        <!-- We use the <pre> tag because in this case, we actually want to browser to display the white space that we show.  -->

        


        <pre>
            <code>
                this is the pre <i class="fa fa-tag" aria-hidden="true"></i>



                and it shows spaces where and how we wnat to show them 
            </code>
        </pre>
